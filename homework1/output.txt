80[0]:	   The Bill of Rights in the National Archives
81[0]:	
82[0]:	   The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution
83[1]:	   is the part of the Bill of Rights that prohibits unreasonable searches
84[1]:	   and seizures and requires any warrant to be judicially sanctioned and
85[1]:	   supported by probable cause. It was adopted in response to the abuse of
86[0]:	   the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the
87[0]:	   British government and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary
88[0]:	   America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by
89[0]:	   James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights,
90[0]:	   in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution.
91[0]:	   Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789.
92[0]:	   By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-quarters of the states had
93[0]:	   ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson
94[0]:	   announced the adoption of the amendment.
95[0]:	
96[0]:	   Because the Bill of Rights did not initially apply to the states, and
97[0]:	   federal criminal investigations were less common in the first century
98[0]:	   of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the
99[0]:	   Fourth Amendment before the 20th century. The amendment was held to
100[0]:	   apply to the states in Mapp v. Ohio (1961).
101[0]:	
102[2]:	   Under the Fourth Amendment, search and seizure (including arrest)
103[0]:	   should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied
104[0]:	   to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has
105[0]:	   sworn by it. Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central
106[0]:	   questions: what government activities constitute "search" and
107[2]:	   "seizure"; what constitutes probable cause for these actions; and how
108[0]:	   violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed. Early court
109[0]:	   decisions limited the amendment's scope to a law enforcement officer's
110[0]:	   physical intrusion onto private property, but with Katz v. United
111[0]:	   States (1967), the Supreme Court held that its protections, such as the
112[0]:	   warrant requirement, extend to the privacy of individuals as well as
113[0]:	   physical locations. Law enforcement officers need a warrant for most
114[1]:	   search and seizure activities, but the Court has defined a series of
115[2]:	   exceptions for consent searches, motor vehicle searches, evidence in
116[1]:	   plain view, exigent circumstances, border searches, and other
117[0]:	   situations.
118[0]:	
119[1]:	   The exclusionary rule is one way the amendment is enforced. Established
120[0]:	   in Weeks v. United States (1914), this rule holds that evidence
121[0]:	   obtained through a Fourth Amendment violation is generally inadmissible
122[0]:	   at criminal trials. Evidence discovered as a later result of an illegal
123[0]:	   search may also be inadmissible as "fruit of the poisonous tree,"
124[0]:	   unless it inevitably would have been discovered by legal means.

157[0]:	     The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
158[2]:	     papers, and effects,^[a] against unreasonable searches and seizures,
159[1]:	     shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon
160[1]:	     probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly
161[0]:	     describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
162[0]:	     seized.^[2]
163[0]:	
164[0]:	Background
165[0]:	
166[0]:	English law
167[0]:	
168[0]:	   Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden established the English common law
169[1]:	   precedent against general search warrants.
170[0]:	
171[0]:	   Like many other areas of American law, the Fourth Amendment finds its
172[0]:	   roots in English legal doctrine. Sir Edward Coke, in Semayne's case
173[0]:	   (1604), famously stated: "The house of every one is to him as his
174[0]:	   castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and
175[0]:	   violence as for his repose."^[3] Semayne's Case acknowledged that the
176[0]:	   King did not have unbridled authority to intrude on his subjects'
177[0]:	   dwellings but recognized that government agents were permitted to
178[2]:	   conduct searches and seizures under certain conditions when their
179[0]:	   purpose was lawful and a warrant had been obtained.^[4]
180[0]:	
181[0]:	   The 1760s saw a growth in the intensity of litigation against state
182[1]:	   officers, who, using general warrants, conducted raids in search of
183[0]:	   materials relating to John Wilkes's publications attacking both
184[0]:	   government policies and the King himself. The most famous of these
185[0]:	   cases involved John Entick, whose home was forcibly entered by the
186[0]:	   King's Messenger Nathan Carrington, along with others, pursuant to a
187[0]:	   warrant issued by George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax authorizing
188[0]:	   them "to make strict and diligent search for ... the author, or one
189[0]:	   concerned in the writing of several weekly very seditious papers
190[0]:	   intitled, 'The Monitor or British Freeholder, No 257, 357, 358, 360,
191[0]:	   373, 376, 378, and 380,'" and seized printed charts, pamphlets and
192[0]:	   other materials. Entick filed suit in Entick v Carrington, argued
193[0]:	   before the Court of King's Bench in 1765. Charles Pratt, 1st Earl
194[1]:	   Camden ruled that both the search and the seizure was unlawful, as the
195[1]:	   warrant authorized the seizure of all of Entick's papers—not just the
196[1]:	   criminal ones—and as the warrant lacked probable cause to even justify
197[0]:	   the search. By holding that "[O]ur law holds the property of every man
198[0]:	   so sacred, that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour's close
199[0]:	   without his leave",^[5] Entick established the English precedent that
200[0]:	   the executive is limited in intruding on private property by common
201[0]:	   law.^[4]
202[0]:	
203[0]:	Colonial America
204[0]:	
205[0]:	   Homes in Colonial America, on the other hand, did not enjoy the same
206[0]:	   sanctity as their British counterparts, because legislation had been
207[0]:	   explicitly written so as to enable enforcement of British
208[0]:	   revenue-gathering policies on customs; until 1750, in fact, the only
209[0]:	   type of warrant defined in the handbooks for justices of the peace was
210[0]:	   the general warrant.^[4] During what scholar William Cuddihy called the
211[1]:	   "colonial epidemic of general searches", the authorities possessed
212[0]:	   almost unlimited power to search for anything at any time, with very
213[0]:	   little oversight.^[6]
214[0]:	   Massachusetts lawyer James Otis protested British use of general
215[1]:	   warrants in the American colonies.
216[0]:	
217[0]:	   In 1756, the colony of Massachusetts enacted legislation that barred
218[1]:	   the use of general warrants. This represented the first law in American
219[1]:	   history curtailing the use of seizure power. Its creation largely
220[0]:	   stemmed from the great public outcry over the Excise Act of 1754, which
221[0]:	   gave tax collectors unlimited powers to interrogate colonists
222[0]:	   concerning their use of goods subject to customs. The act also
223[0]:	   permitted the use of a general warrant known as a writ of assistance,
224[0]:	   allowing tax collectors to search the homes of colonists and seize
225[0]:	   "prohibited and uncustomed" goods.^[7]
226[0]:	
227[0]:	   A crisis erupted over the writs of assistance on December 27, 1760 when
228[0]:	   the news of King George II's death on October 23 arrived in Boston. All
229[0]:	   writs automatically expired six months after the death of the King and
230[0]:	   would have had to be re-issued by George III, the new king, to remain
231[0]:	   valid.^[8]
232[0]:	
233[0]:	   In mid-January 1761, a group of over 50 merchants represented by James
234[0]:	   Otis petitioned the court to have hearings on the issue. During the
235[0]:	   five-hour hearing on February 23, 1761, Otis vehemently denounced
236[1]:	   British colonial policies, including their sanction of general warrants
237[0]:	   and writs of assistance.^[9] Future US President John Adams, who was
238[0]:	   present in the courtroom when Otis spoke, viewed these events as "the
239[0]:	   spark in which originated the American Revolution."^[10] However, the
240[0]:	   court ruled against Otis.^[11]
241[0]:	
242[0]:	   Because of the name he had made for himself in attacking the writs,
243[0]:	   Otis was elected to the Massachusetts colonial legislature and helped
244[0]:	   pass legislation requiring that special writs of assistance be "granted
245[0]:	   by any judge or justice of the peace upon information under oath by any
246[0]:	   officer of the customs" and barring all other writs. The governor
247[0]:	   overturned the legislation, finding it contrary to English law and
248[0]:	   parliamentary sovereignty.^[12]
249[0]:	
250[1]:	   Seeing the danger general warrants presented, the Virginia Declaration
251[1]:	   of Rights (1776) explicitly forbade the use of general warrants. This
252[0]:	   prohibition became a precedent for the Fourth Amendment:^[13]
253[0]:	
254[1]:	     That general warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may be
255[0]:	     commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact
256[0]:	     committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, or whose
257[0]:	     offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence, are
258[0]:	     grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted.^[13]
259[0]:	
260[0]:	   Article XIV of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, written by John
261[0]:	   Adams and enacted in 1780 as part of the Massachusetts Constitution,
262[1]:	   added the requirement that all searches must be "reasonable" and served
263[0]:	   as another basis for the language of the Fourth Amendment:^[14]
264[0]:	
265[0]:	     Every subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable
266[2]:	     searches, and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and
267[1]:	     all his possessions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this
268[0]:	     right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously
269[0]:	     supported by oath or affirmation; and if the order in the warrant to
270[1]:	     a civil officer, to make search in suspected places, or to arrest
271[0]:	     one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not
272[0]:	     accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of
273[2]:	     search, arrest, or seizure: and no warrant ought to be issued but in
274[0]:	     cases, and with the formalities, prescribed by the laws.^[15]
275[0]:	
276[0]:	   By 1784, eight state constitutions contained a provision against
277[0]:	   general warrants.^[16]
278[0]:	
279[0]:	Proposal and ratification
280[0]:	
281[0]:	   Main article: United States Bill of Rights
282[0]:	
283[0]:	   After several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles
284[0]:	   of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed
285[0]:	   a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief
286[0]:	   executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention
287[0]:	   delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed
288[0]:	   that a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be
289[0]:	   included. Other delegates—including future Bill of Rights drafter James
290[0]:	   Madison—disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil
291[0]:	   liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual
292[0]:	   rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were
293[0]:	   unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a
294[0]:	   unanimous vote of the state delegations.^[17]
295[0]:	
296[0]:	   For the constitution to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen
297[0]:	   states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to
298[0]:	   ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's
299[0]:	   lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the
300[0]:	   Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification
301[0]:	   (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed
302[0]:	   that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for
303[0]:	   the addition of a bill of rights.^[18] Four state conventions proposed
304[0]:	   some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government
305[0]:	   to conduct searches.^[16]
306[0]:	   James Madison, drafter of the Bill of Rights
307[0]:	
308[0]:	   In the 1st United States Congress, following the state legislatures'
309[0]:	   request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based
310[0]:	   on state bills of rights and English sources such as the Bill of Rights
311[1]:	   1689, including an amendment requiring probable cause for government
312[1]:	   searches. Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to
313[0]:	   twelve, and these were submitted to the states for ratification on
314[0]:	   September 25, 1789.^[19]
315[0]:	
316[0]:	   By the time the Bill of Rights was submitted to the states for
317[0]:	   ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists,
318[0]:	   who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill as
319[0]:	   a means of silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism.
320[0]:	   Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the
321[0]:	   Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second
322[0]:	   constitutional convention, which they desired.^[20] Anti-Federalists
323[0]:	   such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most
324[0]:	   objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal
325[0]:	   judiciary and direct taxation, intact.^[21]
326[0]:	
327[0]:	   On November 20, 1789, New Jersey ratified eleven of the twelve
328[0]:	   amendments, including the Fourth. On December 19, 1789, December 22,
329[0]:	   1789, and January 19, 1790, respectively, Maryland, North Carolina, and
330[0]:	   South Carolina ratified all twelve amendments.^[22] On January 25 and
331[0]:	   28, 1790, respectively, New Hampshire and Delaware ratified eleven of
332[0]:	   the Bill's twelve amendments, including the Fourth.^[22] This brought
333[0]:	   the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the
334[0]:	   process stalled in other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill
335[0]:	   of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts
336[0]:	   ratified most of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to
337[0]:	   the Secretary of State that it had done so. (All three states would
338[0]:	   later ratify the Bill of Rights for sesquicentennial celebrations in
339[0]:	   1939.)^[21]
340[0]:	
341[0]:	   In February through June of 1790, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode
342[0]:	   Island each ratified eleven of the amendments, including the Fourth.
343[0]:	   Virginia initially postponed its debate, but after Vermont was admitted
344[0]:	   to the Union in 1791, the total number of states needed for
345[0]:	   ratification rose to eleven. Vermont ratified on November 3, 1791,
346[0]:	   approving all twelve amendments, and Virginia finally followed on
347[0]:	   December 15, 1791.^[21] Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced
348[0]:	   the adoption of the ten successfully ratified amendments on March 1,
349[0]:	   1792.^[23]
350[0]:	
351[0]:	Applicability
352[0]:	
353[0]:	   The Bill of Rights originally only restricted the federal government,
354[0]:	   and went through a long initial phase of "judicial dormancy";^[24] in
355[0]:	   the words of historian Gordon S. Wood, "After ratification, most
356[0]:	   Americans promptly forgot about the first ten amendments to the
357[0]:	   Constitution."^[25] Federal jurisdiction regarding criminal law was
358[0]:	   narrow until the late 19th century when the Interstate Commerce Act and
359[0]:	   Sherman Antitrust Act were passed. As federal criminal jurisdiction
360[0]:	   expanded to include other areas such as narcotics, more questions about
361[0]:	   the Fourth Amendment came to the Supreme Court.^[26] The U.S. Supreme
362[0]:	   Court responded to these questions by outlining the fundamental purpose
363[0]:	   of the amendment as guaranteeing "the privacy, dignity and security of
364[0]:	   persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the
365[0]:	   Government, without regard to whether the government actor is
366[0]:	   investigating crime or performing another function."^[27] In Mapp v.
367[0]:	   Ohio (1961),^[28] the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth
368[0]:	   Amendment applies to the states by way of the Due Process Clause of the
369[0]:	   Fourteenth Amendment.^[29]
370[0]:	
371[0]:	   Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central issues: what
372[1]:	   government activities constitute "search" and "seizure"; what
373[1]:	   constitutes probable cause for these actions; how violations of Fourth
374[0]:	   Amendment rights should be addressed.^[30]
375[0]:	
376[0]:	   The Fourth Amendment typically requires "a neutral and detached
377[0]:	   authority interposed between the police and the public," and it is
378[2]:	   offended by "general warrants" and laws that allows searches to be
379[0]:	   conducted "indiscriminately and without regard to their connection with
380[0]:	   [a] crime under investigation.",^[31] for the "basic purpose of the
381[0]:	   Fourth Amendment, which is enforceable against the States through the
382[1]:	   Fourteenth, through its prohibition of "unreasonable" searches and
383[1]:	   seizures is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals
384[0]:	   against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials."^[32]
385[0]:	
386[1]:	   The Fourth Amendment has been held to mean that a search or an arrest
387[0]:	   generally requires a judicially sanctioned warrant, because the basic
388[1]:	   rule under the Fourth Amendment is that arrests and "searches conducted
389[0]:	   outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or
390[0]:	   magistrate, are per se unreasonable."^[33] In order for such a warrant
391[1]:	   to be considered reasonable, it must be supported by probable cause and
392[0]:	   be limited in scope according to specific information supplied by a
393[0]:	   person (usually a law enforcement officer) who has sworn by it and is
394[0]:	   therefore accountable to the issuing court. The Supreme Court further
395[0]:	   held in Chandler v. Miller (1997): "To be reasonable under the Fourth
396[0]:	   Amendment, a search ordinarily must be based on individualized
397[1]:	   suspicion of wrongdoing. But particularized exceptions to the main rule
398[0]:	   are sometimes warranted based on 'special needs, beyond the normal need
399[0]:	   for law enforcement.' ... When such 'special needs' are alleged, courts
400[0]:	   must undertake a context-specific inquiry, examining closely the
401[0]:	   competing private and public interests advanced by the parties."^[34]
402[2]:	   The amendment applies to governmental searches and seizures, but not
403[0]:	   those done by private citizens or organizations who are not acting on
404[0]:	   behalf of a government.^[35] In Ontario v. Quon (2010), the Court held
405[0]:	   the amendment to also apply to the government when acting as an
406[0]:	   employer, ruling that a government could search a police officer's text
407[0]:	   messages that were sent over that government's pager.^[27]^[36]
408[0]:	
409[0]:	Search
410[0]:	
411[0]:	   Potter Stewart wrote the majority decision in Katz v. United States,
412[0]:	   which expanded Fourth Amendment protections to electronic surveillance.
413[0]:	
414[0]:	   One threshold question in the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is whether
415[0]:	   a "search" has occurred. Initial Fourth Amendment case law hinged on a
416[0]:	   citizen's property rights—that is, when the government physically
417[0]:	   intrudes on "persons, houses, papers, or effects" for the purpose of
418[0]:	   obtaining information, a "search" within the original meaning of the
419[0]:	   Fourth Amendment has occurred. Early 20th-century Court decisions, such
420[0]:	   as Olmstead v. United States (1928), held that Fourth Amendment rights
421[0]:	   applied in cases of physical intrusion, but not to other forms of
422[0]:	   police surveillance (e.g., wiretaps).^[37] In Silverman v. United
423[0]:	   States (1961), the Court stated of the amendment that "at the very core
424[0]:	   stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be
425[0]:	   free from unreasonable governmental intrusion."^[38]
426[0]:	
427[0]:	   Fourth Amendment protections expanded significantly with Katz v. United
428[0]:	   States (1967).^[37]^[39] In Katz, the Supreme Court expanded that focus
429[0]:	   to embrace an individual's right to privacy, and ruled that a search
430[0]:	   had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a
431[0]:	   microphone attached to the outside of the glass. While there was no
432[0]:	   physical intrusion into the booth, the Court reasoned that: 1) Katz, by
433[0]:	   entering the booth and shutting the door behind him, had exhibited his
434[1]:	   expectation that "the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be
435[1]:	   broadcast to the world"; and 2) society believes that his expectation
436[0]:	   was reasonable. Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion
437[0]:	   that "the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places".^[40] A
438[0]:	   "search" occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the
439[1]:	   government violates a person's "reasonable expectation of
440[1]:	   privacy."^[41] Katz's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided
441[0]:	   the basis to rule that the government's intrusion, though electronic
442[0]:	   rather than physical, was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment, and
443[0]:	   thus necessitated a warrant.^[37]^[42] The Court said that it was not
444[0]:	   recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment,^[43]
445[0]:	   and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures
446[0]:	   had been followed.^[42]
447[0]:	
448[0]:	   This decision in Katz was later developed into the now commonly used
449[0]:	   two-prong test, adopted in Smith v. Maryland (1979),^[44] for
450[0]:	   determining whether the Fourth Amendment is applicable in a given
451[0]:	   circumstance:^[45]^[46]
452[1]:	    1. a person "has exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of
453[0]:	       privacy"; and
454[1]:	    2. society is prepared to recognize that this expectation is
455[0]:	       (objectively) reasonable.
456[0]:	
457[1]:	   An individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information
458[0]:	   provided to third parties.^[44]^[47] In Smith, the Supreme Court held
459[1]:	   individuals have no "legitimate expectation of privacy" regarding the
460[0]:	   telephone numbers they dial because they knowingly give that
461[0]:	   information to telephone companies when they dial a number.^[48]
462[0]:	
463[0]:	   Following Katz, the vast majority of Fourth Amendment search cases have
464[0]:	   turned on the right to privacy, but in United States v. Jones (2012),
465[0]:	   the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case
466[0]:	   law, but rather, has supplemented it.^[49] In Jones, law enforcement
467[0]:	   officers had attached a GPS device on a car's exterior without Jones'
468[0]:	   knowledge or consent. The Court concluded that Jones was a bailee to
469[0]:	   the car, and so had a property interest in the car.^[50] Therefore,
470[0]:	   since the intrusion on the vehicle—a common law trespass—was for the
471[0]:	   purpose of obtaining information, the Court ruled that it was a search
472[0]:	   under the Fourth Amendment. The Court used similar "trespass" reasoning
473[0]:	   in Florida v. Jardines (2013), to rule that bringing a drug detection
474[0]:	   dog to sniff at the front door of a home was a search.^[51]
475[0]:	
476[0]:	   In certain situations, law enforcement may perform a search when they
477[1]:	   have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, even if it falls
478[2]:	   short of probable cause necessary for an arrest. Under Terry v. Ohio
479[0]:	   (1968), law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct a limited
480[2]:	   warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause
481[0]:	   under certain circumstances. In Terry, the Supreme Court ruled that
482[0]:	   when a police officer witnesses "unusual conduct" that leads that
483[0]:	   officer to reasonably believe "that criminal activity may be afoot",
484[0]:	   that the suspicious person has a weapon and that the person is
485[0]:	   presently dangerous to the officer or others, the officer may conduct a
486[0]:	   "pat-down search" (or "frisk") to determine whether the person is
487[0]:	   carrying a weapon.^[52] This detention and search is known as a Terry
488[0]:	   stop. To conduct a frisk, officers must be able to point to specific
489[0]:	   and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences
490[0]:	   from those facts, reasonably warrant their actions.^[53] As established
491[0]:	   in Florida v. Royer (1983), such a search must be temporary, and
492[0]:	   questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop (e.g., officers
493[1]:	   who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe
494[0]:	   that the person was driving a stolen car, cannot, after confirming that
495[0]:	   it is not stolen, compel the person to answer questions about anything
496[0]:	   else, such as the possession of contraband).^[54]^[55]
497[0]:	
498[1]:	Seizure
499[0]:	
500[1]:	   The Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable seizure of any person,
501[0]:	   person's home (including its curtilage) or personal property without a
502[1]:	   warrant. A seizure of property occurs when there is "some meaningful
503[0]:	   interference with an individual's possessory interests in that
504[0]:	   property",^[56] such as when police officers take personal property
505[0]:	   away from an owner to use as evidence, or when they participate in an
506[1]:	   eviction.^[57] The amendment also protects against unreasonable seizure
507[0]:	   of persons, including a brief detention.^[58]
508[0]:	
509[1]:	   A seizure does not occur just because the government questions an
510[1]:	   individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar
511[0]:	   voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in
512[0]:	   a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if
513[0]:	   his freedom of movement is not restrained.^[54]^[59] The government may
514[0]:	   not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective
515[0]:	   grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not
516[0]:	   by itself furnish such grounds.^[58]
517[0]:	
518[0]:	   Per United States v. Mendenhall (1980), a person is seized within the
519[0]:	   meaning of the Fourth Amendment only when, by means of physical force
520[0]:	   or show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained and, in the
521[0]:	   circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would
522[0]:	   believe that he was not free to leave.^[58] In Florida v. Bostick
523[0]:	   (1991), the Court ruled that as long as the police do not convey a
524[0]:	   message that compliance with their requests is required, the police
525[0]:	   contact is a "citizen encounter" that falls outside the protections of
526[0]:	   the Fourth Amendment.^[60] If a person remains free to disregard
527[1]:	   questioning by the government, there has been no seizure and therefore
528[0]:	   no intrusion upon the person's privacy under the Fourth Amendment.^[58]
529[0]:	
530[0]:	   When a person is arrested and taken into police custody, he has been
531[0]:	   seized (i.e., a reasonable person who is handcuffed and placed in the
532[0]:	   back of a police car would not think they were free to leave). A person
533[0]:	   subjected to a routine traffic stop on the other hand, has been seized,
534[0]:	   but is not "arrested" because traffic stops are a relatively brief
535[0]:	   encounter and are more analogous to a Terry stop than to a formal
536[1]:	   arrest.^[61] If a person is not under suspicion of illegal behavior, a
537[0]:	   law enforcement official is not allowed to place an individual under
538[1]:	   arrest simply because this person does not wish to state his identity,
539[0]:	   provided specific state regulations do not specify this to be the
540[1]:	   case.^[62] A search incidental to an arrest that is not permissible
541[0]:	   under state law does not violate the Fourth Amendment, so long as the
542[1]:	   arresting officer has probable cause.^[63]^[64] In Maryland v. King
543[0]:	   (2013), the Court upheld the constitutionality of police swabbing for
544[0]:	   DNA upon arrests for serious crimes, along the same reasoning that
545[1]:	   allows police to take fingerprints or photographs of those they arrest
546[0]:	   and detain.^[65]^[66]
547[0]:	
548[0]:	Exceptions
549[0]:	
550[0]:	   The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without
551[1]:	   reasonable and articulable suspicion, with a few exceptions. In
552[0]:	   Delaware v. Prouse (1979), the Court ruled an officer has made an
553[1]:	   illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in
554[0]:	   order to check his driver's license and the registration of the
555[1]:	   automobile, unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion
556[0]:	   that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered,
557[1]:	   or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure
558[0]:	   for violation of law.^[67]^[68]
559[0]:	
560[0]:	   Where society's need is great, no other effective means of meeting the
561[0]:	   need is available, and intrusion on people's privacy is minimal,
562[0]:	   certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain
563[0]:	   motorists. In United States v. Martinez-Fuerte (1976), the Supreme
564[0]:	   Court allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints.^[69] In Michigan
565[0]:	   Dept. of State Police v. Sitz (1990), the Supreme Court allowed
566[0]:	   discretionless sobriety checkpoints.^[70] In Illinois v. Lidster
567[0]:	   (2004), the Supreme Court allowed focused informational
568[0]:	   checkpoints.^[71] However, in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond (2000),
569[0]:	   the Supreme Court ruled that discretionary checkpoints or general
570[0]:	   crime-fighting checkpoints are not allowed.^[72]
571[0]:	
572[0]:	Warrant
573[0]:	
574[0]:	   Under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement must receive written
575[0]:	   permission from a court of law, or otherwise qualified magistrate, to
576[0]:	   lawfully search and seize evidence while investigating criminal
577[0]:	   activity. A court grants permission by issuing a writ known as a
578[1]:	   warrant. A search or seizure is generally unreasonable and
579[0]:	   unconstitutional if conducted without a valid warrant^[73] and the
580[1]:	   police must obtain a warrant whenever practicable. ^[74] Searches and
581[1]:	   seizures without a warrant are not considered unreasonable if one of
582[0]:	   the specifically established and well-delineated exceptions to the
583[0]:	   warrant requirement applies.^[37]^[75]^[76] These exceptions apply
584[0]:	   "[o]nly in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs,
585[0]:	   beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and
586[1]:	   probable cause requirement impracticable."^[77]
587[0]:	
588[0]:	   In these situations where the warrant requirement doesn't apply a
589[1]:	   search or seizure nonetheless must be justified by some individualized
590[1]:	   suspicion of wrongdoing.^[78] However, the U.S. Supreme Court carved
591[1]:	   out an exception to the requirement of individualized suspicion. It
592[0]:	   ruled that, "In limited circumstances, where the privacy interests
593[0]:	   implicated by the search are minimal and where an important
594[0]:	   governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in
595[1]:	   jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion" a search [or
596[1]:	   seizure] would still be reasonable.^[79]
597[0]:	
598[1]:	Probable cause
599[0]:	
600[1]:	   Main article: Probable cause
601[0]:	
602[2]:	   The standards of probable cause differ for an arrest and a search. The
603[2]:	   government has a probable cause to make an arrest when "the facts and
604[0]:	   circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably
605[0]:	   trustworthy information" would lead a prudent person to believe that
606[0]:	   the arrested person had committed or was committing a crime.^[80]
607[3]:	   Probable cause to arrest must exist before the arrest is made. Evidence
608[1]:	   obtained after the arrest may not apply retroactively to justify the
609[0]:	   arrest.^[81]
610[0]:	
611[0]:	   When police conduct a search, the amendment requires that the warrant
612[1]:	   establish probable cause to believe that the search will uncover
613[0]:	   criminal activity or contraband. They must have legally sufficient
614[0]:	   reasons to believe a search is necessary. In Carroll v. United States
615[1]:	   (1925), the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a
616[0]:	   flexible, common-sense standard.^[82]^[83] To that end, the Court ruled
617[1]:	   in Dumbra v. United States (1925) that the term probable cause means
618[0]:	   "less than evidence that would justify condemnation",^[84] reiterating
619[0]:	   Carroll's assertion that it merely requires that the facts available to
620[0]:	   the officer would "warrant a man of reasonable caution" in the belief
621[0]:	   that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as
622[0]:	   evidence of a crime.^[85] It does not demand any showing that such a
623[0]:	   belief be correct or more likely true than false. A "practical,
624[0]:	   non-technical" probability that incriminating evidence is involved is
625[0]:	   all that is required.^[86] In Illinois v. Gates (1983), the Court ruled
626[0]:	   that the reliability of an informant is to be determined based on the
627[0]:	   "totality of the circumstances."^[87]
628[0]:	
629[0]:	Exceptions to the warrant requirement
630[0]:	
631[0]:	Consent
632[0]:	
633[0]:	   Main article: Consent search
634[0]:	
635[0]:	   If a party gives consent to a search, a warrant is not required. There
636[0]:	   are exceptions and complications to the rule, including the scope of
637[0]:	   the consent given, whether the consent is voluntarily given, and
638[0]:	   whether an individual has the right to consent to a search of another's
639[0]:	   property.^[88] In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973), the Court ruled
640[0]:	   that a consent search is still valid even if the police do not inform a
641[0]:	   suspect of his right to refuse the search.^[89] This contrasts with
642[0]:	   Fifth Amendment rights, which cannot be relinquished without an
643[0]:	   explicit Miranda warning from police.^[90]
644[0]:	
645[0]:	   The Court stated in United States v. Matlock (1974) that a third party
646[0]:	   co-occupant could give consent for a search without violating a
647[0]:	   suspect's Fourth Amendment rights.^[91]^[92] Per the Court's ruling in
648[0]:	   Illinois v. Rodriguez (1990),^[93] a consent search is still considered
649[0]:	   valid if police accept in good faith the consent of an "apparent
650[0]:	   authority", even if that party is later discovered to not have
651[0]:	   authority over the property in question.^[92]
652[0]:	
653[0]:	Plain view and open fields
654[0]:	
655[0]:	   Main articles: Plain view doctrine and Open-fields doctrine
656[0]:	
657[0]:	   According to the plain view doctrine as defined in Coolidge v. New
658[0]:	   Hampshire (1971),^[94] if an officer is lawfully present, he may seize
659[0]:	   objects that are in "plain view". However, the officer must have had
660[1]:	   probable cause to believe that the objects are contraband.^[95]
661[0]:	
662[0]:	   Similarly, "open fields" such as pastures, open water, and woods may be
663[0]:	   searched without a warrant, on the ground that conduct occurring
664[1]:	   therein would have no reasonable expectation of privacy. The doctrine
665[0]:	   was first articulated by the Court in Hester v. United States (1924),
666[0]:	   which stated that "the special protection accorded by the Fourth
667[0]:	   Amendment to the people in their 'persons, houses, papers, and
668[0]:	   effects,' is not extended to the open fields."^[96]
669[0]:	
670[0]:	   In Oliver v. United States (1984),^[97] the police ignored a "no
671[0]:	   trespassing" sign and a fence, trespassed onto the suspect's land
672[0]:	   without a warrant, followed a path for hundreds of feet, and discovered
673[0]:	   a field of marijuana. The Supreme Court ruled that no search had taken
674[1]:	   place, because there was no privacy expectation regarding an open
675[0]:	   field:
676[0]:	
677[0]:	     open fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities
678[0]:	     that the Amendment is intended to shelter from government
679[0]:	     interference or surveillance. There is no societal interest in
680[0]:	     protecting the privacy of those activities, such as the cultivation
681[0]:	     of crops, that occur in open fields.^[98]
682[0]:	
683[0]:	   While open fields are not protected by the Fourth Amendment, the
684[0]:	   curtilage, or outdoor area immediately surrounding the home, is
685[0]:	   protected. Courts have treated this area as an extension of the house
686[0]:	   and as such subject to all the privacy protections afforded a person's
687[0]:	   home (unlike a person's open fields) under the Fourth Amendment. The
688[0]:	   curtilage is "intimately linked to the home, both physically and
689[0]:	   psychologically," and is where "privacy expectations are most
690[0]:	   heightened."^[99] However, courts have held aerial surveillance of
691[0]:	   curtilage not to be included in the protections from unwarranted search
692[0]:	   so long as the airspace above the curtilage is generally accessible by
693[0]:	   the public. An area is curtilage if it "harbors the intimate activity
694[0]:	   associated with the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of
695[0]:	   life."^[100] Courts make this determination by examining "whether the
696[0]:	   area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature
697[0]:	   of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the
698[0]:	   resident to protect the area from observation by people passing
699[0]:	   by."^[101] The Court has acknowledged that a doorbell or knocker is
700[0]:	   typically treated as an invitation, or license, to the public to
701[0]:	   approach the front door of the home to deliver mail, sell goods,
702[0]:	   solicit for charities, etc. This license extends to the police, who
703[0]:	   have the right to try engaging a home's occupant in a "knock and talk"
704[0]:	   for the purpose of gathering evidence without a warrant. However, they
705[0]:	   cannot bring a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home
706[0]:	   without either a warrant or consent of the homeowner or resident.^[102]
707[0]:	
708[0]:	Exigent circumstance
709[0]:	
710[0]:	   Main article: Exigent circumstance in United States law
711[0]:	
712[1]:	   Law enforcement officers may also conduct warrantless searches in
713[0]:	   several types of exigent circumstances where obtaining a warrant is
714[0]:	   dangerous or impractical. One example is the Terry stop, which allows
715[0]:	   police to frisk suspects for weapons.^[103] The Court also allowed a

719[0]:	   Court ruled that law enforcement officers could search a vehicle that
720[0]:	   they suspected of carrying contraband without a warrant.^[103] The
721[0]:	   Court allowed blood to be drawn without a warrant from drunk-driving
722[0]:	   suspects in Schmerber v. California (1966) on the grounds that the time
723[0]:	   to obtain a warrant would allow a suspect's blood alcohol content to
724[0]:	   reduce.^[103]^[105] Warden v. Hayden (1967) provided an exception to
725[0]:	   the warrant requirement if officers were in "hot pursuit" of a

730[0]:	   Main article: Motor vehicle exception
731[0]:	
732[0]:	   The Supreme Court has held that individuals in automobiles have a
733[1]:	   reduced expectation of privacy, because vehicles generally do not serve
734[0]:	   as residences or repositories of personal effects. Vehicles may not be
735[1]:	   randomly stopped and searched; there must be probable cause or
736[1]:	   reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Items in plain view may be
737[0]:	   seized; areas that could potentially hide weapons may also be searched.
738[1]:	   With probable cause to believe evidence is present, police officers may
739[0]:	   search any area in the vehicle. However, they may not extend the search
740[1]:	   to the vehicle's passengers without probable cause to search those
741[0]:	   passengers or consent from the passengers.^[107]
742[0]:	
743[0]:	   In Arizona v. Gant (2009),^[108] the Court ruled that a law enforcement
744[0]:	   officer needs a warrant before searching a motor vehicle after an
745[1]:	   arrest of an occupant of that vehicle, unless 1) at the time of the
746[0]:	   search the person being arrested is unsecured and within reaching
747[0]:	   distance of the passenger compartment of the vehicle or 2) police
748[0]:	   officers have reason to believe that evidence for the crime for which
749[0]:	   the person is being arrested will be found in the vehicle.^[109]
750[0]:	
751[2]:	Searches incident to a lawful arrest
752[0]:	
753[2]:	   Main article: Searches incident to a lawful arrest
754[0]:	
755[1]:	   A common law rule from Great Britain permits searches incident to an
756[1]:	   arrest without a warrant. This rule has been applied in American law,
757[0]:	   and has a lengthy common law history.^[110] The justification for such
758[0]:	   a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1.) from destroying
759[0]:	   evidence or 2.) using a weapon against the arresting officer by
760[0]:	   disarming the suspect.^[111] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that "both
761[0]:	   justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent
762[0]:	   and the rule does not apply", when "there is no possibility" that the
763[0]:	   suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence.^[112] In
764[0]:	   Trupiano v. United States (1948), the Supreme Court held that "a search
765[2]:	   or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has
766[0]:	   always been considered to be a strictly limited right. It grows out of
767[1]:	   the inherent necessities of the situation at the time of the arrest.
768[0]:	   But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a
769[0]:	   lawful arrest."^[113] In United States v. Rabinowitz (1950), the Court
770[0]:	   reversed Trupiano, holding instead that the officers' opportunity to
771[0]:	   obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search
772[1]:	   incident to an arrest. Rabinowitz suggested that any area within the
773[0]:	   "immediate control" of the arrestee could be searched, but it did not
774[0]:	   define the term.^[114] In deciding Chimel v. California (1969), the
775[0]:	   Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions. It held that when an
776[1]:	   arrest is made, it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee
777[0]:	   for weapons and evidence.^[115] However, in Riley v. California (2014),
778[0]:	   the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant
779[0]:	   to search an arrestee's cellular phone. The Court said that earlier
780[2]:	   Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest
781[0]:	   without a warrant do not apply to “modern cellphones, which are now
782[0]:	   such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial
783[0]:	   visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of
784[0]:	   human anatomy,” and noted that US citizens' cellphones today typically
785[0]:	   contain “a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives — from
786[0]:	   the mundane to the intimate.”^[116]^[117]
787[0]:	
788[0]:	Border search exception
789[0]:	
790[0]:	   Main article: Border search exception
791[0]:	
792[1]:	   Searches conducted at the United States border or the equivalent of the
793[0]:	   border (such as an international airport) may be conducted without a
794[1]:	   warrant or probable cause subject to the border search
795[1]:	   exception.^[118]^[119]^[120]^[121] Most border searches may be
796[1]:	   conducted entirely at random, without any level of suspicion, pursuant
797[0]:	   to U.S. Customs and Border Protection plenary search authority.
798[1]:	   However, searches that intrude upon a traveler's personal dignity and
799[1]:	   privacy interests, such as strip and body cavity searches, must be
800[0]:	   supported by "reasonable suspicion."^[120]^[122] The U.S. Courts of
801[0]:	   Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth circuits have ruled that information
802[0]:	   on a traveler's electronic materials, including personal files on a
803[0]:	   laptop computer, may be searched at random, without
804[0]:	   suspicion.^[120]^[123]^[124]
805[0]:	
806[0]:	Foreign intelligence surveillance
807[0]:	
808[0]:	   The Supreme Court decision in United States v. U.S. District Court
809[0]:	   (1972)^[125] left open the possibility for a foreign intelligence
810[0]:	   surveillance exception to the warrant clause.^[126] Three United States
811[0]:	   Courts of Appeals have recognized a foreign intelligence surveillance
812[0]:	   exception to the warrant clause, but tied it to certain
813[0]:	   requirements.^[126] The exception to the Fourth Amendment was formally
814[0]:	   recognized by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
815[0]:	   of Review in its 2008 In re Directives^[127] decision.^[128] The lower
816[0]:	   court held that, "a foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth
817[0]:	   Amendment's warrant requirement exists when surveillance is conducted
818[0]:	   to obtain foreign intelligence for national security purposes and is
819[0]:	   directed against foreign powers or agents of foreign powers reasonably
820[0]:	   believed to be located outside the United States."^[128] Despite the
821[0]:	   foregoing citation the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against
822[2]:	   unreasonable searches and seizures nonetheless apply to the contents of
823[0]:	   all communications, whatever the means, because, "a person's private
824[0]:	   communications are akin to personal papers."^[129] To protect the
825[0]:	   telecommunication carriers cooperating with the US government from
826[0]:	   legal action, the Congress passed a bill updating the Foreign
827[0]:	   Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to permit this type of
828[0]:	   surveillance.^[130]
829[0]:	
830[0]:	Other exceptions
831[0]:	
832[1]:	   In New Jersey v. T. L. O. (1985), the Supreme Court ruled that searches
833[1]:	   in public schools do not require warrants, as long as the searching
834[0]:	   officers have reasonable grounds for believing that the search will
835[0]:	   result in the finding of evidence of illegal activity.^[76] However, in
836[0]:	   Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009),^[131] the Court
837[0]:	   ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they
838[0]:	   strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to
839[0]:	   have received drugs from that student.^[132] Similarly, in Samson v.
840[0]:	   California (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may be
841[0]:	   searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government
842[1]:	   employees on similar grounds.^[133] Searches of prison cells are
843[1]:	   subject to no restraints relating to reasonableness or probable
844[0]:	   cause.^[134]
845[0]:	
846[1]:	Exclusionary rule
847[0]:	
848[1]:	   Main article: Exclusionary rule
849[0]:	
850[0]:	   One way courts enforce the Fourth Amendment is through the use of the
851[1]:	   exclusionary rule. The rule provides that evidence obtained through a
852[0]:	   violation of the Fourth Amendment is generally not admissible by the
853[0]:	   prosecution during the defendant's criminal trial.^[135] The Court
854[0]:	   stated in Elkins v. United States (1960)^[136] that the rule's function
855[0]:	   "is to deter—to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the
856[0]:	   only effectively available way—by removing the incentive to disregard
857[0]:	   it."^[135]
858[0]:	
859[1]:	   The Court adopted the exclusionary rule in Weeks v. United States
860[0]:	   (1914),^[104] prior to which all evidence, no matter how seized, could
861[0]:	   be admitted in court.^[137] In Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States
862[0]:	   (1920)^[138] and Nardone v. United States (1939),^[139] the Court ruled
863[0]:	   that leads or other evidence resulting from illegally obtained evidence
864[0]:	   are also inadmissible in trials. Justice Felix Frankfurter described
865[0]:	   this secondary evidence in the Nardone decision as the "fruit of the
866[0]:	   poisonous tree".^[140] The Supreme Court rejected incorporating the
867[1]:	   exclusionary rule by way of the Fourteenth Amendment in Wolf v.
868[0]:	   Colorado (1949),^[141] but explicitly overruled this decision in Mapp
869[0]:	   v. Ohio (1961),^[28] making the Fourth Amendment (including the
870[1]:	   exclusionary rule) applicable in state proceedings.^[142]
871[0]:	
872[1]:	   The exclusionary rule and its effectiveness have often been
873[0]:	   controversial, particularly since its 1961 application to state
874[0]:	   proceedings. Critics charge that the rule hampers police investigation
875[0]:	   and can result in freeing guilty parties convicted on reliable
876[0]:	   evidence; other critics state that the rule has not been successful in
877[1]:	   deterring illegal police searches. Proponents argue that the number of
878[0]:	   criminal convictions overturned under the rule has been minimal and
879[0]:	   that no other effective mechanism exists to enforce the Fourth
880[0]:	   Amendment.^[135] In 1982, California passed a "Victim's Bill of Rights"
881[1]:	   containing a provision to repeal the exclusionary rule; though the bill
882[0]:	   could not affect federally mandated rights under the Fourth Amendment,
883[0]:	   it blocked the state courts from expanding these protections
884[0]:	   further.^[143]^[144]
885[0]:	
886[0]:	Limitations
887[0]:	
888[1]:	   Responding to criticisms of the exclusionary rule, the Supreme Court
889[0]:	   has instituted numerous limitations to the rule.^[135] In United States
890[0]:	   v. Calandra (1974),^[145] the Court ruled that in questioning
891[0]:	   witnesses, grand juries may use evidence that allegedly was illegally
892[0]:	   obtained because, "the damage to that institution from the
893[1]:	   unprecedented extension of the exclusionary rule outweighs the benefit
894[0]:	   of any possible incremental deterrent effect."^[146]
895[0]:	
896[1]:	   Several cases in 1984 further restricted the exclusionary rule. In
897[0]:	   United States v. Leon,^[147] the Court, applying the "good faith" rule,
898[0]:	   ruled that evidence seized by officers relying in good faith on a
899[0]:	   warrant was still admissible, even though the warrant was later found
900[0]:	   to be defective. Evidence would be excluded, however, if an officer
901[0]:	   dishonestly or recklessly prepared an affidavit to seek a warrant, the
902[0]:	   issuing magistrate abandoned his neutrality, or the warrant lacked
903[0]:	   sufficient particularity.^[148] The Court determined in Nix v.
904[0]:	   Williams^[149] that "fruit of the poisonous tree" evidence could still
905[0]:	   be introduced if a prosecutor could demonstrate that it would have been
906[0]:	   an "inevitable discovery" of legitimate investigation.^[150] In Segura
907[0]:	   v. United States,^[151] the Court ruled that evidence illegally found
908[0]:	   without a search warrant is admissible if the evidence is later found
909[0]:	   and legally seized based on information independent of the illegal
910[0]:	   search.^[152]
911[0]:	
912[0]:	   In Arizona v. Evans (1995)^[153] and Herring v. United States
913[1]:	   (2009),^[154] the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule does not apply
914[0]:	   to evidence found due to negligence regarding a government database, as
915[0]:	   long as the arresting police officer relied on that database in "good
916[0]:	   faith" and the negligence was not pervasive.^[155]^[156] In Davis v.
917[1]:	   United States (2011),^[157] the Court ruled that the exclusionary rule
918[0]:	   does not apply to a Fourth Amendment violation resulting from a
919[0]:	   reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent.^[158]
920[0]:	
921[0]:	   The rule has also been held not to apply in the following
922[0]:	   circumstances:
923[0]:	     * evidence illegally seized by a "private actor" (i.e., not a
924[0]:	       governmental employee)^[159]
925[0]:	     * evidence seized from a common carrier^[160]
926[0]:	     * tax hearings^[161]
927[0]:	     * evidence collected by U.S. Customs agents^[162]
928[0]:	     * deportation hearings^[163]
929[0]:	     * military discharge proceedings^[164]
930[0]:	     * evidence seized by probation or parole officers^[165]
931[0]:	     * child protective proceedings^[166]
932[0]:	     * probation or parole revocation hearings^[167]
